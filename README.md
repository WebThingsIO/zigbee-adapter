# Zigbee Adapter

Zigbee device adapter for Mozilla's WebThings Gateway.

## Compatibility

This adapter is compatible with the following USB dongles:
* Digi XStick2 (XU-Z11)
* ConBee Zigbee USB stick
* ConBee II Zigbee USB stick
* TI CC253x-based dongles
    * These must be flashed with the firmware in the `firmware` directory of
      this repository, following [these instructions](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/flashing_the_cc2531.html), 
	  or using [Raspberry Pi](https://lemariva.com/blog/2019/07/zigbee-flashing-cc2531-using-raspberry-pi-without-cc-debugger)
	* Last time [ITEAD](https://www.itead.cc/cc2531-usb-dongle.html) sells them preprogrammed with some ZNP firmware - probably working with this plugin.
